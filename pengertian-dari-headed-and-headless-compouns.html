After we ate breakfast, we arrived at the zoo and entered. We walked towards the first animals. I Looked up at a giraffe as itu stared back at me. I insisted on seeing the lions. We saw home monkeys that played, and some penguins that swam. We stopped for a rest, then we headed to the farm where there were woolly sheep and goats who tried to eat my jumper. Later, we went along the paths and left. Our car  bumped and swayed as we slept during the journey home. We had a lovely day at the zoo. ​</a>

We walked towards the first animals. I Looked up at a giraffe as itu stared back at me. I insisted on seeing the lions. We saw home monkeys that played, and some penguins that swam. We stopped for a rest, then we headed to the farm where there were woolly sheep and goats who tried to eat my jumper. Later, we went along the paths and left. Our cara bumped and swayed as we slept during the journey home. We had a lovely day at the zoo. ​</a>
