Hans Christian Andersen
Once upon a time there lived a great storyteller whose tales delighted both children and adults. He told a story about an emperor who had a new wardrobe and about a tiny girl who was no taller than a person's thumb.
That storyteller's name was Hans Christian Andersen, and his fans celebrated the anniversary of his 200th birthday in 2005.
People are told Andersen's fairy tales in countries such as Denmark and Egypt. Andersen's fans also commemorated the anniversary with a variety of celebrations. In New York City's Central Park, storyteller Ellen Shapiro read "The Princess and the Pea" to a crowd of children.
In Denmark, 15-foot-tall puppets danced in midair every night from May until September. In Singapore, the post office published a series of Andersen stamps. And in Egypt, the library in Alexandria has displayed Andersen's books, translated into 150 languages!
"Andersen's stories have everything," Shapiro told Senior Edition. "They are funny and sad and joyous. I never get tired of them."
Tell Me a Story!
Storytellers such as Shapiro love carrying on Andersen's tradition. Shapiro doesn't memorize her favorite stories, however. Instead, she learns what happens at the beginning, middle, and end. She changes the words of a story to fit the audience. Therefore, no two tellings of a story are exactly alike. 
"Everyone has a story," Shapiro said. "You just have to find it."
Father of the Fairy Tale
Hans Christian Andersen (1805–1875) was born in Denmark. He wrote more than 150 stories. He became the first author to write and publish his own fairy tales.
Andersen grew up poor. His father was a shoemaker, and his mother could barely read. Andersen once said, "Most of what I have written is a reflection of myself." His fairy tale, "The Ugly Duckling," about a duckling that is teased by other animals until it grows up to be a swan, was based on the way Andersen was treated as a child.
His other famous fairy tales include "The Emperor's New Clothes," "The Little Mermaid," and "Thumbelina."

                                            TEXT 5 THE JACK STORIES (Folklore)
‒‒‒‒
Once upon a time, there was a boy named Jack. He lived with his
mother. They were very poor. Jack's mother told him to sell the cow and
to use the money to buy food. Jack sold the cow and got the money.
But he spent the money on some magic beans. Jack's mother was
really mad at him. But he stayed cheerful. He planted the magic beans
and soon had a beanstalk growing up to the sky. Up the beanstalk he
went. He found a rich giant. He stole the giant's money. Back on the
ground, he cut down the beanstalk and the giant was killed, Jack and
his mother lived happily ever after.
You know all about Jack and the Beanstalk. This story is one of a large
body of folk tales about Jack. The Scots-Irish settlers brought the Jack Stories
from Scotland to Ireland to the United States as they migrated over a long
period of time. You can still hear some of the Jack stories if you can find an
old storyteller in the outback of the Appalachian Mountains.

Hans Christian Andersen
Once upon a time there lived a great storyteller whose tales delighted both children and adults. He told a story about an emperor who had a new wardrobe and about a tiny girl who was no taller than a person's thumb.
That storyteller's name was Hans Christian Andersen, and his fans celebrated the anniversary of his 200th birthday in 2005.
People are told Andersen's fairy tales in countries such as Denmark and Egypt. Andersen's fans also commemorated the anniversary with a variety of celebrations. In New York City's Central Park, storyteller Ellen Shapiro read "The Princess and the Pea" to a crowd of children.
In Denmark, 15-foot-tall puppets danced in midair every night from May until September. In Singapore, the post office published a series of Andersen stamps. And in Egypt, the library in Alexandria has displayed Andersen's books, translated into 150 languages!
"Andersen's stories have everything," Shapiro told Senior Edition. "They are funny and sad and joyous. I never get tired of them."
Tell Me a Story!
Storytellers such as Shapiro love carrying on Andersen's tradition. Shapiro doesn't memorize her favorite stories, however. Instead, she learns what happens at the beginning, middle, and end. She changes the words of a story to fit the audience. Therefore, no two tellings of a story are exactly alike. 
"Everyone has a story," Shapiro said. "You just have to find it."
Father of the Fairy Tale
Hans Christian Andersen (1805–1875) was born in Denmark. He wrote more than 150 stories. He became the first author to write and publish his own fairy tales.
Andersen grew up poor. His father was a shoemaker, and his mother could barely read. Andersen once said, "Most of what I have written is a reflection of myself." His fairy tale, "The Ugly Duckling," about a duckling that is teased by other animals until it grows up to be a swan, was based on the way Andersen was treated as a child.
His other famous fairy tales include "The Emperor's New Clothes," "The Little Mermaid," and "Thumbelina."

                            20. TEXT 5 THE JACK STORIES (Folklore)
‒‒‒‒
Once upon a time, there was a boy named Jack. He lived with his
mother. They were very poor. Jack's mother told him to sell the cow and
to use the money to buy food. Jack sold the cow and got the money.
But he spent the money on some magic beans. Jack's mother was
really mad at him. But he stayed cheerful. He planted the magic beans
and soon had a beanstalk growing up to the sky. Up the beanstalk he
went. He found a rich giant. He stole the giant's money. Back on the
ground, he cut down the beanstalk and the giant was killed, Jack and
his mother lived happily ever after.
You know all about Jack and the Beanstalk. This story is one of a large
body of folk tales about Jack. The Scots-Irish settlers brought the Jack Stories
from Scotland to Ireland to the United States as they migrated over a long
period of time. You can still hear some of the Jack stories if you can find an
old storyteller in the outback of the Appalachian Mountains.

She stopped fighting after 3 years, although her son-in-law continued fighting.  Despite fighting the Dutch, beginning in 1833 they gave her an annuity of 100 guilders per month.
