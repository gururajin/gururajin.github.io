                                            Event 1My guess was right when I came to the court. I came a little bit late because I had to wait for my friend's preparation. He is a hardcore Sukadana supporters. So, he wore all of the attributes related to Sukadana Village. Both supporters screamed their heart out to give their support to both teams. They couldn't wait to see the match.Event 2The match had started. Both teams were good at attacking and defending. However, Sukamaju had more scoring chances. Luckily, Picture of soccer match we had a great goalkeeper named Agus Cahyadi. The first half was still 0-0. I was a little bit worried after seeing Sukamaju's performance in the first half. I hope Sukadana would improve their games in the second half. Event 3The second half was underway. At the 76 minutes, Sukadana got a corner. The corner was kicked by Antono straight to the goal. He used his special banana shoot. Sukamaju's goalkeeper didn't expect that shoot. He rushed to the back to catch the ball, but it was too late. The ball entered the goalpost. Sukadana's supporters jumped in their excitement. They screamed "Antono... Antono....lalalalala....Antono".ReorientationSukamaju tried everything to score the goals but to no avail. At the end, the score was 1-0 for Sukadana. Sukadana's supporters shouted and cheered all of the teams, especially Antono who had provided such a beautiful goal.LISTENINGTask 1Listen to the text and then fill in the blank spaces with the correct words.Tolong bantuan nya kak​</a>

                                            A Bundle of SticksOnce upon a time, three neighbors living in a village were having trouble with their crops. Each of the neighbors had one field, but the crops on their fields were infested with pests and were wilting. Every day, they would come up with different ideas to help their crops. The first one tried using a scarecrow in his field, the second used pesticides, and the third built a fence on his field, all to no avail. One day, the village head came by and called the three farmers. He gave them each a stick and asked them to break it. The farmers could break them easily. He then gave them a bundle of three sticks, and again, asked them to break it. This time, the farmers struggled to break the sticks. The village head said, “Together, you are stronger and work better than you do it alone.” The farmers understood what the village head was saying. They pooled in their resources and got rid of the pests from their fields. Answer the following questions. 1. What is the social function of the text? 2.

Spoof 1:
A blonde and a lawyer are seated next to each other on a flight from LA to NY.
The lawyer asks if she would like to play a fun game.
The blonde, tired, just wants to take a nap, politely declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks.
The lawyer persists and explains that the game is easy and a lot of fun.
He explains, "I ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me $5.00, and vise versa."
Again, she declines and tries to get some sleep. The lawyer, now agitated, says, "Okay, if you don't know the answer you pay me $5.00, and if I don't know the answer, I will pay you $500.00."
This catches the blonde's attention and, figuring there will be no end to this torment unless she plays, agrees to the game. The lawyer asks the first question. "What's the distance from the earth to the moon?" The blonde doesn't say a word, reaches into her purse, pulls out a $5.00 bill and hands it to the lawyer. "Okay" says the lawyer, "your turn."
She asks the lawyer, "What goes up a hill with three legs and comes down with four legs?" The lawyer, puzzled, takes out his laptop computer and searches all his references, no answer. He taps into the air phone with his modem and searches the net and the library of congress, no answer. Frustrated, he sends e-mails to all his friends and coworkers, to no avail. After an hour, he wakes the blonde, and hands her $500.00.
The blonde says, "Thank you", and turns back to get some more sleep.
The lawyer, who is more than a little miffed, wakes the blonde and asks, "Well, what's the answer?" Without a word, the blonde reaches into her purse, hands the lawyer $5.00, and goes back to sleep.
Spoof 2:
Two vampire bats wake up in the middle of the night, thirsty for blood. One says, “Let’s fly out of the cave and get some blood.”
“We’re new here,” says the second one. “It’s dark out, and we don’t know where to look. We’d better wait until the other bats go with us.”
The first bat replies, “Who needs them? I can find some blood somewhere.” He flies out of the cave.
When he returns, he is covered with blood.
The second bat says excitedly, “Where did you get the blood?”
The first bat takes his buddy to the mouth of the cave. Pointing into the night, he asks, “See that black building over there?”
“Yes,” the other bat answers.
“Well,” says the first bat, “I didn’t.”

He taps into the air phone with his modem and searches the net and the library of congress, no answer. Frustrated, he sends e-mails to all his friends and coworkers, to no avail. After an hour, he wakes the blonde, and hands her $500.00.
The blonde says, "Thank you", and turns back to get some more sleep.
The lawyer, who is more than a little miffed, wakes the blonde and asks, "Well, what's the answer?" Without a word, the blonde reaches into her purse, hands the lawyer $5.00, and goes back to sleep.
Spoof 2:
Two vampire bats wake up in the middle of the night, thirsty for blood. One says, “Let’s fly out of the cave and get some blood.”
“We’re new here,” says the second one. “It’s dark out, and we don’t know where to look. We’d better wait until the other bats go with us.”
The first bat replies, “Who needs them? I can find some blood somewhere.” He flies out of the cave.
When he returns, he is covered with blood.
The second bat says excitedly, “Where did you get the blood?”
The first bat takes his buddy to the mouth of the cave. Pointing into the night, he asks, “See that black building over there?”
“Yes,” the other bat answers.
“Well,” says the first bat, “I didn’t.”

 The Legend of Bukit Merah 
A long time ago, the seas of Singapura was inhabited by many dangerous swordfish that attacked the villagers living by the sea. The king, Raja Paduka Sri Maharaja tried several methods to solve this problem, but to no avail.
A clever little boy saw what was happening and suggested the king to make a trap for the swordfish along the beach with soft banana tree trunks. So, the Raja sent his soldiers to cut down all the banana trees nearby and built a barrier along the beach. When it was high tide again, the swordfish swam up to the beach. However, instead of attacking villagers, the swordfish found their sharp noses stuck onto the banana tree trunks!
The little boy's plan had succeeded and the grateful villagers thanked the boy for saving their lives. The jealous Raja grew worried that the boy might grow up and take away his throne. So he plotted to kill the boy.
One night, he sent his soldiers to murder the boy who lived on top of a hill. As they marched up the hill, they met a mysterious old woman who discovered their plan. She chanted some magic words and deep red blood started to flow down the hill, causing the terrified soldiers to flee quickly.
The blood eventually caused the soil to turn red and the hill became today's Bukit Merah or Red Hill.

                                            The Lion KingOnce upon a time, there lived a lion. He lives in the depths of the forest along with various other animals. There are elephants, giraffes, squirrels, monkeys, mice, and so on. However, he refused to mingle with them. To even say hello, the lion was reluctant to do so.This is because the lion feels that he is a king. He is the strongest among the other animals. Thus, he felt that he could live alone and did not need any help from others. However, his arrogance turned out to be fruitless.One day, a large tree fell and crushed the lion’s body. Even though he had used all of the power he had, it was to no avail. He is too proud to ask other animals for help. However, at this rate, he might die.Because of that, the lion ventured to ask for help from other animals in the forest. Despite not liking the lion’s arrogance, the other animals couldn’t just sit idly by. Because of that, they worked together to free him.Once free, the lion felt guilty. Apparently, he can’t live alone because it’s not uncommon for him to need the help of others. Then, the lion thanked them and promised not to be arrogant anymore.state the resolution of the following fable​</a>

There was a motor racing event held in my city several months before the pandemic. Hearing the news that my friend, Andi, took part in the race, I wanted to watch the event. I came to Andi and said that some friends and I would watch the event. He was happy to hear it.The day of the event arrived; we went there to watch Andi. When we got at the venue, a lot of people had filled the place. We bought some bottles of iced coffee. I liked the taste of the drinks. The event turned out to be more than just a motorcycle race; it was also a motorcycle modification exhibition. We took the time to see the exhibition. I was amazed to see some extremely modified motors. Faintly, I also heard the sounds of motorbikes and the clapping of the spectators watching the race. Sometimes we also smelled the gasoline used by the racers.After a while, we heard an announcement that Andi's 125cc class was about to start. We immediately headed to the circuit to get the front row. We saw Andi getting ready at the starting line. The scene at the starting line gave me goosebumps, and seeing the riders on their motorcycles pumped up my adrenaline. The spectators cheered on the racers. So did weA few moments later, the race started, and the starting flag was hoisted. We saw Andi speeding away. We felt both excited and scared when Andi and the other racers tried to overtake each other. I felt the sun burned my skin but I ignored it. I didn't even have time to drink, even though I was thirsty because of the tense.The race was getting tense when it was only two laps away. Andi tried to catch up with and overtake the racer number two, but to no avail. The race was over, Andi was at the position three. We are relieved that the race was over. Andi might be a bit disappointed because he was only at the third position. But for us, that was extraordinary to see Andi's opponents who were really great.answer this question!1.) What does the text tell you about? 2.)When was the event held? 3.)What is the main idea of the 2nd paragraph?4.)What did the writer do before watching the race? 5.)"We immediately headed to the circuit to get the front row."

In storm-ravaged Santa Clarita, California, last March, Margarito Martinez approached 
Road Runner Road carefully. A swollen creek had flooded it. Martinez, driving a Toyota SUV, 
figured he’d be OK. Big mistake. 
Halfway across, the rushing waters grabbed hold of his vehicle, sweeping it off the road 
washing it down a rocky streambed. It finally stopped a good 80 feet away, when the water 
somehow lifted the SUV and wedged it in the ground at a 45-degree angle. Bruised, shaken, and 
trapped inside with the muddy rising quickly, Martinez was certain he was going to die. 
On the road right behind Martinez were a party-rental delivery worker and his niece. They 
watched the horror unfold, and when Martinez’s SUV came to rest in the middle of the gushing 
creek, the man leaped to act. First, he grabbed heavy-duty straps from the back of his van and 
secured the teetering SUV to nearby posts. Then he climbed atop Martinez’s vehicle and banged 
on a rear window with his fists. Frustrated, he returned to his niece and yelled, “Give me a rock!”. 
Over and over he smashed the rock into the window, to no avail. “We were scared that something 
else was going to come down and take the SUV, take him, take my uncle,” Krystina Reyes, 27, told 
CBSLA. 
Reyes’ uncle shouted to Martinez to move away from the window. He braced himself – right 
foot on the spare tire, left in the wheel well. He leaned back and threw the rock. Finally, the glass 
broke and the man kicked in the remaining shards. Soon, a soaked Martinez emerged through the 
window frame, and the men escaped to dry land.

The Fox and The Grapes

One sunny day, the fox woke up and saw the grapes glistening by the sunlight. The vineyard looked heavenly and the grapes looked so luscious that the famished fox could no longer control itself. He jumped to reach them but fell down.

Spoof 1:
A blonde and a lawyer are seated next to each other on a flight from LA to NY.
The lawyer asks if she would like to play a fun game.
The blonde, tired, just wants to take a nap, politely declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks.
The lawyer persists and explains that the game is easy and a lot of fun.
He explains, "I ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me $5.00, and vise versa."
Again, she declines and tries to get some sleep. The lawyer, now agitated, says, "Okay, if you don't know the answer you pay me $5.00, and if I don't know the answer, I will pay you $500.00."
This catches the blonde's attention and, figuring there will be no end to this torment unless she plays, agrees to the game. The lawyer asks the first question. "What's the distance from the earth to the moon?" The blonde doesn't say a word, reaches into her purse, pulls out a $5.00 bill and hands it to the lawyer. "Okay" says the lawyer, "your turn."
She asks the lawyer, "What goes up a hill with three legs and comes down with four legs?" The lawyer, puzzled, takes out his laptop computer and searches all his references, no answer. He taps into the air phone with his modem and searches the net and the library of congress, no answer. Frustrated, he sends e-mails to all his friends and coworkers, to no avail. After an hour, he wakes the blonde, and hands her $500.00.
The blonde says, "Thank you", and turns back to get some more sleep.
The lawyer, who is more than a little miffed, wakes the blonde and asks, "Well, what's the answer?" Without a word, the blonde reaches into her purse, hands the lawyer $5.00, and goes back to sleep.
Spoof 2:
Two vampire bats wake up in the middle of the night, thirsty for blood. One says, “Let’s fly out of the cave and get some blood.”
“We’re new here,” says the second one. “It’s dark out, and we don’t know where to look. We’d better wait until the other bats go with us.”
The first bat replies, “Who needs them? I can find some blood somewhere.” He flies out of the cave.
When he returns, he is covered with blood.
The second bat says excitedly, “Where did you get the blood?”
The first bat takes his buddy to the mouth of the cave. Pointing into the night, he asks, “See that black building over there?”
“Yes,” the other bat answers.
“Well,” says the first bat, “I didn’t.”

 The Legend of Bukit Merah 
A long time ago, the seas of Singapura was inhabited by many dangerous swordfish that attacked the villagers living by the sea. The king, Raja Paduka Sri Maharaja tried several methods to solve this problem, but to no avail.
A clever little boy saw what was happening and suggested the king to make a trap for the swordfish along the beach with soft banana tree trunks. So, the Raja sent his soldiers to cut down all the banana trees nearby and built a barrier along the beach. When it was high tide again, the swordfish swam up to the beach. However, instead of attacking villagers, the swordfish found their sharp noses stuck onto the banana tree trunks!
The little boy's plan had succeeded and the grateful villagers thanked the boy for saving their lives. The jealous Raja grew worried that the boy might grow up and take away his throne. So he plotted to kill the boy.
One night, he sent his soldiers to murder the boy who lived on top of a hill. As they marched up the hill, they met a mysterious old woman who discovered their plan. She chanted some magic words and deep red blood started to flow down the hill, causing the terrified soldiers to flee quickly.
The blood eventually caused the soil to turn red and the hill became today's Bukit Merah or Red Hill.

                            21. The Lion KingOnce upon a time, there lived a lion. He lives in the depths of the forest along with various other animals. There are elephants, giraffes, squirrels, monkeys, mice, and so on. However, he refused to mingle with them. To even say hello, the lion was reluctant to do so.This is because the lion feels that he is a king. He is the strongest among the other animals. Thus, he felt that he could live alone and did not need any help from others. However, his arrogance turned out to be fruitless.One day, a large tree fell and crushed the lion’s body. Even though he had used all of the power he had, it was to no avail. He is too proud to ask other animals for help. However, at this rate, he might die.Because of that, the lion ventured to ask for help from other animals in the forest. Despite not liking the lion’s arrogance, the other animals couldn’t just sit idly by. Because of that, they worked together to free him.Once free, the lion felt guilty. Apparently, he can’t live alone because it’s not uncommon for him to need the help of others. Then, the lion thanked them and promised not to be arrogant anymore.state the resolution of the following fable​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>The resolution of the following fable is the part where the lion is freed from the fallen tree by the help of other animals, and he feels guilty and promises not to be arrogant anymore. The resolution is the outcome of the conflict or problem that the characters face in the story. It usually shows how the characters have changed or learned a lesson from their experience. In this fable, the resolution also contains a moral message that arrogance is not a good trait and that we should appreciate and cooperate with others.</p><br />

I came to Andi and said that some friends and I would watch the event. He was happy to hear it.The day of the event arrived; we went there to watch Andi.

The event turned out to be more than just a motorcycle race; it was also a motorcycle modification exhibition. We took the time to see the exhibition. I was amazed to see some extremely modified motors. Faintly, I also heard the sounds of motorbikes and the clapping of the spectators watching the race. Sometimes we also smelled the gasoline used by the racers.After a while, we heard an announcement that Andi's 125cc class was about to start. We immediately headed to the circuit to get the front row. We saw Andi getting ready at the starting line. The scene at the starting line gave me goosebumps, and seeing the riders on their motorcycles pumped up my adrenaline. The spectators cheered on the racers.

Andi tried to catch up with and overtake the racer number two, but to no avail. The race was over, Andi was at the position three. We are relieved that the race was over.

                            28. 4. Swept Away
In storm-ravaged Santa Clarita, California, last March, Margarito Martinez approached 
Road Runner Road carefully. A swollen creek had flooded it. Martinez, driving a Toyota SUV, 
figured he’d be OK. Big mistake. 
Halfway across, the rushing waters grabbed hold of his vehicle, sweeping it off the road 
washing it down a rocky streambed. It finally stopped a good 80 feet away, when the water 
somehow lifted the SUV and wedged it in the ground at a 45-degree angle. Bruised, shaken, and 
trapped inside with the muddy rising quickly, Martinez was certain he was going to die. 
On the road right behind Martinez were a party-rental delivery worker and his niece. They 
watched the horror unfold, and when Martinez’s SUV came to rest in the middle of the gushing 
creek, the man leaped to act. First, he grabbed heavy-duty straps from the back of his van and 
secured the teetering SUV to nearby posts. Then he climbed atop Martinez’s vehicle and banged 
on a rear window with his fists. Frustrated, he returned to his niece and yelled, “Give me a rock!”. 
Over and over he smashed the rock into the window, to no avail. “We were scared that something 
else was going to come down and take the SUV, take him, take my uncle,” Krystina Reyes, 27, told 
CBSLA. 
Reyes’ uncle shouted to Martinez to move away from the window. He braced himself – right 
foot on the spare tire, left in the wheel well. He leaned back and threw the rock. Finally, the glass 
broke and the man kicked in the remaining shards. Soon, a soaked Martinez emerged through the 
window frame, and the men escaped to dry land.
